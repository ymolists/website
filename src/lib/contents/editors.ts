    question:
      "I changed my IDE preference, but Gitpod still opens VS Code, what should I do?",
    answer:
      "You must start a new workspace to see the JetBrains IDE prompt. Workspaces created before the preferences are updated will not show the JetBrains prompt. Workspaces will respect user preferences on start-up. <i>If you change your preferences you must stop your workspace and restart it</i>. Also, do note that when a workspace restarts, the Code With Me link will also update/change.",
