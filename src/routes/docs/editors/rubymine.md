## Desktop

We will soon have support for JetBrains RubyMine. JetBrains have been working recently to enable remote development for all their products. If you're interested to be part of the Gitpod private Beta group, [leave a comment in our GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6342).

## Browser (via Jetbrains Projector)

Did you know you can run JetBrains IDEs in a browser? Thanks to [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/) IntelliJ-based and Swing-based IDEs can run on servers, allowing you to access them from anywhere using your browser. Here's an example template: [gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-rubymine](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-rubymine).

Simply click "Open in Gitpod" button to launch the RubyMine IDE in your browser.
