# Life of a Workspace

- [Timeouts](#timeouts)
- [Garbage Collection](#garbage-collection)
- [Changes Are Saved](#changes-are-saved)

Gitpod makes creating fresh workspaces as easy as [clicking a button on a repository page](/docs/browser-extension).
Gitpod's continuous dev environments encourages you to create fresh workspaces rather than restarting older ones.
This ensures that you are starting from a clean slate with proper configuration.

## Timeouts

Any running workspace will automatically stop after some time of inactivity. Normally, this timeout is 30 minutes but is extended to **60 minutes if you have an _Unleashed_ plan**.
Furthermore, _Unleashed_ users can manually boost the timeout of a workspace to 180 minutes. This comes in handy, e.g. in case you want to go out for a longer lunch or meeting and don't like restarting your workspace when coming back.

To do that, open the editor's Command Palette (⇧⌘P or Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Gitpod: Extend Workspace Timeout".

**Note**: If you do not have an _Unleashed_ plan, this command is not available.

The timeout will always be reset to the full 30 minutes (or other applicable timeout depending on your subscription) by any activity&thinsp;—&thinsp;mouse move or keystroke&thinsp;—&thinsp;in the editor.
If the editor is still open but the corresponding workspace has stopped, a dialog will pop up that lets you start the workspace
again. Alternatively, you can just reload the browser or go to your [workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) and restart the workspace.

For convenience, closing the browser window/tab containing the workspace reduces the timeout to 3 minutes.

### What happens if my workspace times out?

Not to worry, your changes are safe. You can navigate back to https://gitpod.io, look for your stopped workspace and start it again to continue working.

## Garbage Collection

Old, unused workspaces are automatically deleted.

Unused workspaces are deleted on a schedule. There is no fixed amount of workspaces that are kept by Gitpod. To know exactly how long your past workspaces will be kept, a message is displayed at the top of the [workspaces list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in your dashboard. Restarting a workspace resets the day counter for this particular workspace.

To prevent a workspace from being deleted, you can pin it in your [list of workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/). Pinned workspaces are kept forever.

## Changes are Saved

Gitpod backs up the state of the `/workspace/` folder between workspace starts, so that
you can revisit them later. _Attention: Files in other locations will not be saved!_
