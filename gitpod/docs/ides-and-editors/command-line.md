It is possible currently to access your Gitpod workspaces via the command line using [local companion](/docs/ides-and-editors/local-companion). Using the local companion app, you can connect to your workspaces via SSH. Then, once connected to your workspace you can initiate any text editor of choice, e.g. [vim](https://www.vim.org/). You can then further personalise your setup using [dotfiles](/docs/config-dotfiles).
