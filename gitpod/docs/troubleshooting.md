# Troubleshooting

If you cannot find your issue here or in the documentation, please contact Gitpod via our [Support page](/support).

## Gitpod logs in VS Code Web and Desktop

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the Visual Studio Code environment. They are useful for diagnosing connection issues and other unexpected behavior.

- Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Windows)) and type **Export logs**, select **Gitpod: Export all logs** from the list to download a zip file containing all of the logs.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to support@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

## Gitpod logs in JetBrains Gateway

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the JetBrains Gateway. They are useful for diagnosing issues when connecting to a workspace, issues from Gateway Plugins and issues preventing the JetBrains Client to open.

- Open the **Help** menu and select **Collect Logs and Diagnostic Data** option. After a few seconds, the file manager window will show up, revealing the location where the zip file containing all the logs has been saved.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to support@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

**Note:** Ensure you are using the latest version of [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway) and [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway), as issues from older versions might have already been fixed.

## Gitpod logs in JetBrains Client

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the JetBrains IDE. They are useful for diagnosing connection issues, issues from IDE Plugins, and any unexpected behavior from the client and the server.

- Open the **Help** menu and select **Collect Host and Client logs** option. After a few seconds, the file manager window will show up, revealing the location where the zip file containing all the logs has been saved.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to support@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

**Note:** Ensure you are using the latest version of both [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway) and [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway), as issues from older versions might have already been fixed.

## Why doesn't the "ClearURLs" browser extension work with Gitpod?

The ClearURLs browser extension for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk?hl=en) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/) inhibits Gitpod workspaces from initialising and the problem manifests with the following symptoms:

- The dark theme doesn't load
- The bottom left Gitpod button is missing
- The VS Code Marketplace does not load
- Settings Sync does not work

This issue can be resolved by disabling "ETag filtering" in ClearURLs’ settings. An [issue has been created](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/-/issues/977) that requests to whitelist Gitpod by default and we would appreciate your upvotes on the issue.

## What should I do if JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod aren't working?

1. Ensure you are using the latest version of [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)
2. Ensure you are using the latest version of the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway)

## What can I do if I have unsynced data inside a workspace but it's not starting?

While this is a very critical issue, our workspace-team would eventually look into why it's happening but on the other hand you might not be able to wait while things get fixed. As an user you can try and get your workspace data yourself:

1. Go to the [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces)
2. Find your workspace from the list
3. Download your workspace like so:
   ![Download a workspace](../../../static/images/docs/troubleshooting/download_a_workspace.png)
4. You can now either try opening a new workspace or use your local machine for a while.
5. The downloaded workspace is a `tar` file which can be extracted with `tar -xf <your-workspace-filename-here>` command on a new Gitpod workspace or in your Linux/MacOS machine. You can use `7-zip` to extract if you're on windows and don't have `tar`.
